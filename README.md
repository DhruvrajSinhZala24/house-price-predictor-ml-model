# House Price Predictor ML Model

## 🏡 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. We use two models to make predictions:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**

Both models are trained on historical housing data and evaluated based on their accuracy. The project also includes a visualization comparing the predicted and actual prices.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts house prices based on various features like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.
- Uses two ML models to compare performance.
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices using scatter plots.
- Calculates metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and metrics

## 🗃️ Dataset
The model uses a CSV file named `data.csv` containing house features and prices. The features include:
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Square footage (living and lot)
- Number of floors
- Waterfront presence
- View rating
- Condition rating
- Square footage above and basement
- Year built and renovated

## 🎯 Results
The models' performance is evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Lower values indicate better accuracy.
- **R² Score**: Closer to 1 indicates a better fit.

The **Random Forest Regressor** usually performs better than **Linear Regression** due to its ability to capture complex patterns.

## 📊 Visualization
A scatter plot visualizes the actual vs. predicted prices. An **ideal fit line** shows perfect predictions, helping to gauge model accuracy visually.
